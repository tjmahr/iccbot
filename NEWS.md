# iccbot 0.0.2

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

* Fix error in app and description. Previously it said that agreement was not 
  available for oneway models. This is incorrect. Consistency is not available 
  for oneway models. (#2, thanks to Caroline Zygar-Hoffmann).

* iccbot version number now included.
